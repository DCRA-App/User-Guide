There are two ways to view assignment details in the APP
1. Click on Assignment tab above the Schedule

This page is the Current Assignment page that the Inspector can work on


![Assignment4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81990744/114632038-c84feb00-9c8b-11eb-9b37-d0955372679f.png)

2. Click on Assignment from the Schedule

Then click on the Enlarge icon

This page is the Detailed Assignmnet page and although it provides all the details, the Inspector cannot work on it because it's not the Current Assignment. The Inspector, however, can Request to Reschedule or Cancel the Assignment from this page
