When you finish inspecting, switch to the CityGov App and locate the assignment (by its Accela number) and click on Perform Inspection. NOTE: Keep in mind that the CityGov app saves the data locally and therefore even if the connection is lost, the inspection can and must continue to be performed. Being offline doesn't mean the app isn't working. The app will sync the data once it comes back online

### Working on overdue inspections 

When working with overdue inspections inspectors should be aware that their schedule view displays the next available future inspection and will not display any overdue inspection upon default. If the inspector has opted to work on an inspection that is overdue by selecting the “In Transit” button.  The system will update the assignment tab to reflect the current inspection being worked on rather than the next available future inspection.  

For example, in Figure 1 below you will see an inspection which is now overdue. 

Selecting the “Assignment” tab Figure 2 will display the information for 21ENF-IC-02439 and not 21ENF-IC-02616 which is now considered overdue.  

By selecting 21ENF-IC-02616 and expanding the details of the card Figure 3 inspectors may opt to work on overdue inspections. Working on an overdue inspection is the exact same process as working on a current or future inspection. Inspectors will select the “In Transit” action from the overdue inspection Figure 4 - 5.  

Once the overdue inspection in considered “In Transit” it will replace any future inspection in the “Assignments” tab.  Meaning, users will now see the overdue inspection details and status in the “Assignment” tab. Inspectors will need to return to the “Schedule” view Figure 6 and select the “Assignment” tab to view the updated “Assignment” Page Figure 7.
